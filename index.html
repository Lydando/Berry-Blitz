  Welcome to Berry Blitz. Berry Blitz is a retro-style 2D survival game whereplayers control an avatar that collects berries while avoiding obstacles and
  predators. The game features a canvas-based rendering system, touch/swipe controls for mobile, and progressive difficulty
  scaling. Players earn points by collecting different types of berries, each with unique scoring values and effects. The
  application is built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend and Express backend, though the current
  implementation primarily focuses on client-side game logic.
